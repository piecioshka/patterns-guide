## Description

Legend:

- Model - The model is the part of the application that handles the logic
  for the application data.
- View - The View is the parts of the application that handle the display
  of the data.
- Controller - The Controller is the part of the application that handles
  user interaction.

Legend (2):

- A model stores data that is retrieved according to commands from the controller
  and displayed in the view.
- A view generates an output presentation to the user based on changes in the model.
- A controller can send commands to the model to update the model's state
  (e.g. editing a document). It can also send commands to its associated view
  to change the view's presentation of the model (e.g. by scrolling through
  a document).
