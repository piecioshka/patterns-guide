## Description

Legend

- The model is an interface defining the data to be displayed or otherwise acted
  upon in the user interface.
- The presenter acts upon the model and the view. It retrieves data from repositories
  (the model), and formats it for display in the view.
- The view is a passive interface that displays data (the model) and routes user
  commands (events) to the presenter to act upon that data.
